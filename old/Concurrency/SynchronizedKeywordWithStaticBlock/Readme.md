## This results in a deadlock. Here are the series of steps that would take place:

An ExecutorService thread would trigger a class loading event for TcpRequestHandler.

* The ExecutorService thread would start by checking if the class has a 'fully initialized' state. Because it is not loaded yet, the state would instead be 'Not initialized.'

* The ExecutorService thread would then acquire an 'initialization lock' on the Class TcpRequestHandler to run its static block.

* The main thread would trigger a class loading event of UdpRequestHandler, and then acquire an 'initialization lock' followed by starting the execution of its static block.

* The static block in TcPRequestHandler will trigger a class loading event of the RequestHandlerRegistrar class. The ExecutorService thread will then acquire an 'initialization lock' of the Class RequestHandlerRegistrar to execute its static block.

* To execute a static method of RequestHandlerRegistrar in a static block of UdpRequestHandler, the main thread would wait to acquire the 'initialization lock' of the RequestHandlerRegistrar, since the class is not loaded yet.

* The static block in RequestHandlerRegistrar will again trigger the class loading event of TcpRequestHandler, and the ExecutorService thread will check the state of the class, which is still 'Not initialized,' but it won't be blocked.

* The ExecutorService thread would then execute the statement of loading UdpRequestHandler from the static block of RequestHandlerRegistrar. The UdpRequestHandler is not loaded yet, but the 'initialization lock' has been acquired by the main thread.
