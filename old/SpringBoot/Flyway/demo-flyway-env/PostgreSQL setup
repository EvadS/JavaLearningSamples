PostgreSQL setup
We are going to show how to install PostgreSQL database on a Debian Linux system.

$ sudo apt-get install postgresql
This command installs PostgreSQL server and related packages.

$ /etc/init.d/postgresql status
We check the status of the database with postgresql status command.

$ sudo -u postgres psql postgres
psql (9.5.10)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# \password postgres
Enter new password:
Enter it again:


After the installation, a postgres user with administration priviliges was created with empty default password. As the first step, we need to set a password for postgres.

$ sudo -u postgres createuser --interactive --password user12
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y
Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
Password:
We create a new database user.

$ sudo -u postgres createdb testdb -O user12
We create a new testdb database with createdb command, which is going to be owned by user12.

$ sudo vi /etc/postgresql/9.5/main/pg_hba.conf
We edit the pg_hba.conf file.

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     trust
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
In order to be able to run a Spring Boot application with a local PostgreSQL installation, we change the authentication method for the Unix domain socket and local connections to trust.

$ sudo service postgresql restart
We restart PostgreSQL to enable the changes.

$ psql -U user12 -d testdb -W
Password for user user12:
psql (9.5.10)
Type "help" for help.

testdb=>
Now we can use the psql tool to connect to the database.
